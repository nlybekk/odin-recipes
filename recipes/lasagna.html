    <p><h4>Description</h4></p>
        <p>This classic lasagna recipe is made with an easy meat sauce as the base. Layer the sauce with noodles and cheese, then bake until bubbly! This is great for feeding a big family and freezes well, too.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 pound dry lasagna noodles (requires 9 lasagna noodles - unbroken)</li>
            <li>15 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1 1/2 pounds (24 ounces) mozzarella cheese, grated or sliced</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><em>Start by making the sauce</em> with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.</li>
            <li><em>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready.</em> We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!</li>
            <li><em>From there, it's just an assembly job.</em> A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.</li>
        </ol>
